### Tested Hardware
- Minleon Pixel Dancer Controller (Web UI version)
- RGBW LED light strings

## Reverse Engineering Credits

This integration was created through reverse engineering of the Pixel Dancer mobile app and web interface using network packet capture analysis. The API commands and color formatting were discovered through careful analysis of HTTP traffic between the app and controller.
